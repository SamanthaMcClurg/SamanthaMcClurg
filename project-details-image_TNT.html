                <h2>The Naked Truth</h2>
                <p>When five very different women sign up for Gabby’s pole dancing class at the local village hall, none of them have any idea what lies ahead.
                    As each of the women’s stories unfold and unravel, they share laughter and tears in this hilariously, sad and ultimately moving play, a call to all women, celebrating strength through adversity.
                    <br/><i>"The group includes...“Faith” (Samantha McClurg), a young, energetic novice who demonstrates naivete as an art form...for me the find of the year is Samantha. 
                        This amazing young woman has had no previous pole-dancing experience and is gracing the boards in a large role for the first time. 
                        I would not be surprised if you don’t believe me. I say it again. WOW!"</i><br/>- Doug Williams, Theatre Reviewer</p>
